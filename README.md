# Pulse propagation in single-mode optical fibers
`nonlinear-pulse` is a numerical engine for the **Nonlinear Schr√∂dinger Equation** (NLSE), an equation which describes pulse propagation in nonlinear and dispersive optical fibers. The solution implements **Split Step Fourier Method** (SSFM). 
Some of the possible uses of this simulator are:
- make predictions on _chromatic dispersion_ (also called GVD: Group Velocity Dispersion) and design dispersion compensating systems,
- make predictions on simple nonlinear phenomena such as _Self Phase Modulation_ (SPM),
- observe numerically the propagation of _optical solitons_ and other correlated effects such as soliton collision.

For additional informations on the physical model, and the various applications of this simulator, you can read my BSc thesis (unfortunately it is in Italian), or, for a more comprehensive view, [Ag].
